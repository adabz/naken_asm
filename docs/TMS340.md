TMS340
======

This assembler works with the Texas Instruments TMS340 series of
chips including the TMS34010 used in Mortal Kombat, IBM 8514 graphics
chip, and other arcade systems.

There is currently some support for TMS34020, but a few instructions
are missing.

This chip is a bit awkward because it does bit addressing rather
than byte.  Currently any instruction that uses addresses is going
to use a byte address by naken_asm.  It might be that using symbols
will require a multiply by 16 to get the correct address.
